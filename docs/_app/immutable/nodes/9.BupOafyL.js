Tax systems in many countries divide capital gains into two categories based on holding period: short-term and long-term.</p> <p class="svelte-q8x3kg">A short-term holding period applies when you sell a cryptocurrency less than one full year after acquiring it. Gains from these transactions are taxed at ordinary income rates, which are typically much higher than capital gains rates.</p> <h2 class="mt-5 fw-bold sapphire-text svelte-q8x3kg">The One-Year Rule Explained</h2> <p class="svelte-q8x3kg">The holding period is calculated from the day after acquisition to the day of disposal. To qualify for long-term treatment, you must hold the asset for at least 365 days. Even holding for 364 days results in short-term taxation.</p> <div class="accent-callout my-5 p-4 rounded-4 shadow-sm svelte-q8x3kg"><h5 class="fw-bold">Practical Example</h5> <p class="mb-0 svelte-q8x3kg">Buying on January 1, 2025, and selling on December 31, 2025, is only 364 days—short-term. Selling on January 2, 2026, or later qualifies as long-term.</p></div> <h2 class="fw-bold sapphire-text svelte-q8x3kg">Tax Rate Differences</h2> <ul class="custom-list svelte-q8x3kg"><li class="svelte-q8x3kg">Short-term gains are added to your regular income and taxed at your marginal income tax rate.</li> <li class="svelte-q8x3kg">Long-term gains often receive preferential rates that are substantially lower.</li> <li class="svelte-q8x3kg">In some countries, very long holding periods may qualify for additional benefits or exemptions.</li></ul> <p class="svelte-q8x3kg">Many investors aim to hold assets across the one-year boundary to benefit from lower rates. However, market volatility can make waiting risky.</p> <p class="svelte-q8x3kg">Because the exact dates matter, maintaining precise records of every purchase and sale is critical. Tools that automatically calculate the number of days between acquisition and disposal help eliminate errors in determining classification.</p> <p class="svelte-q8x3kg">Understanding the distinction between short-term and long-term holding periods empowers better decision-making when managing cryptocurrency portfolios.</p> <p class="italic-note mt-5 pt-4 text-center text-muted border-top svelte-q8x3kg">Tax rules differ by jurisdiction. Always verify current regulations applicable to your situation.</p></div></article></div>');function $(p){var e=T();k("q8x3kg",g=>{var s=w(),h=u(y(s),6);a(4),o(()=>n(h,"content",`${c??""}/blog/posts/post3`)),f(()=>{v.title="Short-Term vs Long-Term Holding Periods | Crypto Gains Blog"}),r(g,s)});var t=i(e),m=i(t);a(4),l(t),a(2),l(e),o(()=>n(m,"href",`${c??""}/blog`)),x(1,e,()=>b,()=>({duration:600})),r(p,e)}export{$ as component,A as universal};
