Taking profits gradually or rebalancing requires partial sells — and accurate tracking of what remains is essential for correct capital gains calculation.</p> <p class="svelte-1al8b51">This calculator handles partial sells seamlessly under strict FIFO rules, ensuring every remaining portion of a buy lot retains its original acquisition date and cost basis.</p> <h2 class="mt-5 fw-bold sapphire-text svelte-1al8b51">How Partial Consumption Works</h2> <p class="svelte-1al8b51">When you sell less than a full lot, the tool consumes only the required amount from the oldest available buy first. The leftover quantity stays in the FIFO queue exactly as it was — preserving its original purchase date for future matching.</p> <div class="accent-callout my-5 p-4 rounded-4 shadow-sm svelte-1al8b51"><h5 class="fw-bold">Remaining Lots Keep Aging</h5> <p class="mb-0 svelte-1al8b51">Because unsold portions retain their original date, they continue progressing toward long-term status. This accurate aging prevents premature short-term classification on future sells.</p></div> <h2 class="fw-bold sapphire-text svelte-1al8b51">Chain of Partial Sells Example</h2> <ul class="custom-list svelte-1al8b51"><li class="svelte-1al8b51">Buy 3 BTC in March 2024 at $50,000 each.</li> <li class="svelte-1al8b51">Sell 1 BTC in September 2024 → 2 BTC remain from March lot (still long-term eligible later).</li> <li class="svelte-1al8b51">Sell 0.8 BTC in January 2025 → uses 0.8 from remaining March lot.</li> <li class="svelte-1al8b51">Final 1.2 BTC from March 2024 are still available for future sells with original date.</li></ul> <h2 class="fw-bold sapphire-text svelte-1al8b51">Why Accurate Remainder Tracking Matters</h2> <p class="svelte-1al8b51">Errors in handling leftovers can compound over time, leading to incorrect holding period classification and distorted tax estimates. Proper remainder management ensures every future sell reflects true historical cost and timing.</p> <p class="svelte-1al8b51">Whether you’re dollar-cost averaging, taking periodic profits, or managing a large portfolio, the calculator’s robust partial-sell handling delivers reliable results without manual tracking.</p> <p class="italic-note mt-5 pt-4 text-center text-muted border-top svelte-1al8b51">Precise management of remaining lots is the foundation of trustworthy long-term tax estimation.</p></div></article></div>');function F(m){var a=B();x("1al8b51",d=>{var s=T(),g=b(h(s),6);e(4),r(()=>o(g,"content",`${c??""}/blog/posts/post5`)),f(()=>{v.title="Handling Partial Sells and Remaining Lots | Crypto Gains Blog"}),l(d,s)});var t=i(a),u=i(t);e(4),n(t),e(2),n(a),r(()=>o(u,"href",`${c??""}/blog`)),y(1,a,()=>w,()=>({duration:600})),l(m,a)}export{F as component,R as universal};
