Among the available options, First-In-First-Out (FIFO) is one of the most common and widely accepted approaches by tax authorities around the world.</p> <p class="svelte-1li990r">FIFO assumes that the first coins you purchased are the first ones you sell. This method creates a clear, chronological trail that matches the natural flow of most investors who buy and hold over time.</p> <h2 class="mt-5 fw-bold sapphire-text svelte-1li990r">How FIFO Works in Practice</h2> <p class="svelte-1li990r">Imagine you bought 1 BTC at forty thousand dollars in early 2024, then another 1 BTC at sixty thousand dollars later that year. If you sell 1 BTC when the price reaches seventy thousand dollars, FIFO matches the sale to your earliest purchase—the one at forty thousand dollars. Your taxable gain is therefore thirty thousand dollars.</p> <div class="accent-callout my-5 p-4 rounded-4 shadow-sm svelte-1li990r"><h5 class="fw-bold">Advantages of FIFO</h5> <p class="mb-0 svelte-1li990r">It is simple and straightforward to implement and audit. Most tax agencies default to FIFO when no method is specified, creating a predictable paper trail based on acquisition order.</p></div> <h2 class="fw-bold sapphire-text svelte-1li990r">When FIFO May Not Be Ideal</h2> <ul class="custom-list svelte-1li990r"><li class="svelte-1li990r">In some jurisdictions, alternative methods like LIFO or Specific Identification are permitted.</li> <li class="svelte-1li990r">LIFO can reduce taxable gains in bull markets by matching sales to higher-cost recent purchases.</li> <li class="svelte-1li990r">However, not all countries allow these alternatives, and switching methods requires consistency and documentation.</li></ul> <p class="svelte-1li990r">For most individual investors, especially those with straightforward buy-and-hold patterns, FIFO remains the safest and most practical choice.</p> <p class="svelte-1li990r">Using the correct cost basis method directly affects your reported gains and tax liability. Accurate FIFO application ensures compliance and peace of mind.</p> <p class="italic-note mt-5 pt-4 text-center text-muted border-top svelte-1li990r">FIFO is not the only method, but its clarity and broad acceptance make it a strong default for crypto tax reporting.</p></div></article></div>');function j(d){var t=x();I("1li990r",m=>{var s=O(),u=y(f(s),6);e(4),o(()=>n(u,"content",`${c??""}/blog/posts/post2`)),v(()=>{b.title="Why FIFO Matters for Crypto Taxes | Crypto Gains Blog"}),r(m,s)});var a=i(t),h=i(a);e(4),l(a),e(2),l(t),o(()=>n(h,"href",`${c??""}/blog`)),g(1,t,()=>F,()=>({duration:600})),r(d,t)}export{j as component,$ as universal};
