When you sell, trade, or otherwise dispose of cryptocurrency at a profit, most tax authorities treat the gain as a capital gain.</p> <p class="svelte-1tq17n3">The core principle is simple: capital gains tax applies to the difference between what you paid for the cryptocurrency (your cost basis) and what you received when you disposed of it.</p> <h2 class="mt-5 fw-bold sapphire-text svelte-1tq17n3">Short-Term vs Long-Term Capital Gains</h2> <p class="svelte-1tq17n3">If you hold a cryptocurrency for less than one year before selling, any profit is classified as a <strong>short-term capital gain</strong>. These are taxed at your ordinary income tax rate. If you hold for one year or longer, you qualify for <strong>long-term capital gains</strong>, which benefit from lower tax rates.</p> <div class="accent-callout my-5 p-4 rounded-4 shadow-sm svelte-1tq17n3"><h5 class="fw-bold">Why Holding Period Matters</h5> <p class="mb-0 svelte-1tq17n3">Even a single day short of 365 days can push a large gain into a higher tax bracket.
