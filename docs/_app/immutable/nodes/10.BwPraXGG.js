This calculator applies a straightforward yet precise formula to every matched buy-sell pair.</p> <p class="svelte-jo8es1">For each portion of a sell matched to a prior buy, the gain or loss is calculated as the sell price minus the buy price, multiplied by the quantity involved.</p> <h2 class="mt-5 fw-bold sapphire-text svelte-jo8es1">The Basic Formula</h2> <p class="svelte-jo8es1">Gain equals (sell price minus buy price) times quantity. When sell price exceeds buy price, the result is positive, indicating a profit. When sell price is lower, the result is negative, representing a loss.</p> <div class="accent-callout my-5 p-4 rounded-4 shadow-sm svelte-jo8es1"><h5 class="fw-bold">Handling Losses</h5> <p class="mb-0 svelte-jo8es1">Negative results are fully supported and displayed clearly.

Even small errors can compound into significant tax discrepancies, especially with large volumes.</p> <p class="svelte-jo8es1">Whether realizing substantial profits or offsetting losses, users can rely on the calculator to reflect true financial outcomes based on actual buy and sell prices.</p> <p class="italic-note mt-5 pt-4 text-center text-muted border-top svelte-jo8es1">Accurate gain tracking supports better financial planning and regulatory compliance.</p></div></article></div>');function P(d){var e=A();w("jo8es1",m=>{var t=_(),g=h(v(t),6);s(4),l(()=>n(g,"content",`${c??""}/blog/posts/post6`)),f(()=>{y.title="Calculating Gains and Losses Accurately | Crypto Gains Blog"}),o(m,t)});var a=r(e),u=r(a);s(4),i(a),s(2),i(e),l(()=>n(u,"href",`${c??""}/blog`)),b(1,e,()=>j,()=>({duration:600})),o(d,e)}export{P as component,E as universal};
